# Unveiling Employee Attrition Insights: A Power BI Exploration of HR Data

This is my first Power BI project in which I have utilized a sample HR dataset from a company. The focus of this project was to analyze employee attrition within the organization. I have developed dashboards that showcase the various reasons behind attrition, such as attrition by gender, education level, salary, job role, and experience.

To enhance interactivity and engagement, the dashboards feature components such as cards, sliders, pie charts, graphs, area graphs, and matrices.

Overall, the project revolves around leveraging Power BI's capabilities to delve into the factors contributing to employee attrition and provide valuable insights through visually appealing and interactive dashboards.
